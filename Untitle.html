		<h1>Breaking Bad is a show that showcases the rise and fall of the American dream</h1>\
		<h2>This is simply my opinion</h2>\
		<p>The fitness gram pacer test is a multi stage aerobic capacity test that gets increasingly more difficult the firther you get.</p>\
    <h1>Walter Hardwell White</h1>\
    <h2> Still testing</h2>\
    <p> Body testing finished. Walter Hardwell White is a Alberqerque, New Mexico resident. He is a chemistry teacher at a local school. He has 1 child and an infant whos names are Walter Jr and Holly. He slowly gets more mentally and physically unstable as he does more challenging tasks and as the cancer starts to slowly kill him. Walter was seen as a sympathetic teacher at the beginning and is seen as a pathetic excuse of a teacher, father, husband, and person overall. The only thing hes good at is cooking. He ends up cooking for a man running a resturant name Gustavo Fring. He ends up having some major issues with Gustavo and ends up "getting rid of" Gustavo by using Hector in a wheelchair strapped with a kaboom. He also kills his brother in law "Hank" who is a DEA agent. His family was very distraught and that was the moment Walter went to far. That was the point of no return. His wife was gonna leave him anyway at that point. That was the moment he stopped being human.</p>\
    <h1> Jesse Pinkman</h1>\
    <p> Jesse Pinkman is a former student and accomplice in Walter Whites cooking operations. He plays a major role in the series. Jesse Pinkman started off as an average teen punk who was very amazed that his own chemistry teacher who failed him came to his front door after his accomplice "Emilio Koyama" was arrested. They began cooking together but faced many hardships as a result. Jesse's girlfriend threatened to sabotage the whole cooking operation if she didnt obtain 500,000 dollars. She suggested moving to australia before choking on her own vomit. Walter ended up flipping Jesse's girlfriend on her side indefenitely killing her. She had to be rid of in my opinion since she was sabotaging the whole operation. Jesse was never told what happened that night and if he was it would most certainly destroy the operation. Jesse's brother was poisoned by a ricin cigarette by Walter and Saul Goodman. It was only until later that Jesse figured it out. .\
    <h1>Saul Goodman</h1>\
    <p>Saul Goodman is one of the most likeable and funny characters in Breaking bad. He is a con artist and layer who works in Alberqerque and was Walter White and Jesse Pinkmans Lawyer. He got the two out of many hardships while making a decent amount of money himself which is very impressive especially under the threat of being killed for his actions.\
